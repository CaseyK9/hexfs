# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
# Rename this file to "config.yml".

security:
  # The key to upload.
  masterkey:
  # Max size (in bytes) a file can be. This is 50 MiB.
  # There will always be 1 MB minimum so that the server can respond. If it were 0 bytes,
  # the server would not be able to respond at all LOL
  maxsizebytes: 52428800
  # Key not required to upload if this is true.
  publicmode: false
  # The number of requests that can be made per second.
  # By default, this is 2 because clients must typically make
  # an OPTIONS request, then a POST request, allowing for 1 file/second.
  # If you're not sure, make this value a multiple of 2, or just
  # leave it as is if you don't want to make burst uploads.
  ratelimit: 2
  # A subset of mime type lists which change how files can be displayed.
  filter:
    # A list of mime types to block from loading completely.
    # If no values are given, a blacklist will not be set.
    blacklist:

      - application/x-sh
      - application/x-shar
      - application/x-shellscript
      - text/x-shellscript
    # If this list is populated, then hexFS will ONLY allow these mime types to be displayed.
    # If a mime type from this list is also in the sanitize list, it will be sanitized.
    # If a mime type from this list is also in the blacklist, it will be blacklisted anyway.
    # If no values are given, a blacklist will not be set.
    whitelist:
      - image/png
    # A list of mime types to render as text/plain. Effective against documents like HTML to prevent phishing.
    # If no values are given, no mime types will be sanitized.

  # This default value of 16 means that an IP can only have 16 ongoing uploads/downloads with the server.

  # How many TOTAL requests the server can handle at once.
